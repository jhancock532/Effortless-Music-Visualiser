# What's Next?
Easy
+ ~~Bass, Mid Range, and Upper Range functions.~~ *done!*
+ A three.js example of how the library can be used.
+ Create a page of all functions within the library I advise the user to use.

Difficult
+ You can reset the audio elements.
+ Javascript functions to pause and play the music.
+ A basic beat detection system
+ queue the sound files that you want to play. Loop through when finished.
+ Mess around with min and max decibels.
+ Screw creating an audio element manually! Javascript can do that for us, and keep it hidden with css.

Dreams
+ Create a "read the docs" website
+ Get the library in a awesome js repo (i wish)
+ collaborate with others, and learn lots from it (i really wish)
